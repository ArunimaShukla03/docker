- In case of a database container, when we stop and re-start the container, all the data is lost. That's where "data volumes" come into picture.

- Data volumes are used for data persistence.

- Data volumes basically plug the physical file system path to the virtual or container file system path. 

- The changes made in the virtual file system gets replicated to the host file system and vice-versa.

TYPES OF DOCKER VOLUMES:

1. Host Volume

we decide where on the host we want to mount our container

# docker run -v /home/mount/data:/var/lib/mysql/data

- "-v" indicates volume mount i.e. connecting the host directory to the container directory.

- "/home/mount/data" is the host directory

- "/var/lib/mysql/data" is the container directory

2.  Anonymous Volumes

for each container, a folder is generated automatically by Docker in the Docker internal storage that gets mounted to the container.

these are called anonymous volumes because you don't have a reference to these auto-generated folders

these folders retain data but when the containers are deleted or removed, their data is lost thus anonymous volumes provide temporary storage

# docker run -v /home/mount/data

- volume mount just referencing container directory

3. Named Volume

unlike anonymous volumes, where we don't have reference to those auto-generated folders, here we have reference as they have custom generated names

here we don't need to know the path, just the provided names

they provide flexibilty in terms of where data is stored

we can also store data in the local file system

these should be used in production

benefit: mount reference of the same folder to more than one containers 

# docker run -v my-provided-name:/var/lib/mysql/data
